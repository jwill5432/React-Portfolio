# React-Portfolio

[Deployed Website](https://app.netlify.com/sites/thriving-dasik-d36565/overview)

## Description

The best way to present yourself as a coder who has developed multiple projects is to create a place to showcase your work altogether. This is why i created a react portfolio to display my acheivements as a coder. the webiste is a single page react portfolio that is deployed on the netlify app. The profile contains several projects that can be clicked and a footer to help navigate to the github and resume of the user.

## Installation

The main install besides the files already found in the folder is react. This can be done with npm init -y and npx create-react-app portfolio. This will download all of the necessary files for setting up a react app. Running npm start will start the app that has been created.

## Usage

The Website is a single page that shows several projects and a footer with 2 links to the github and resume. Open any of those and they will take you to the external page. These links will take you to the necessary website for viewing the projects and any accompanying information.
